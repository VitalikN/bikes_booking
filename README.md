## Features

### Description:

The "Bike Booking" feature not only enables registered users to proficiently handle bike statuses but also allows them to contribute actively to the platform by adding new bikes. This comprehensive feature provides advanced capabilities exclusively to authenticated users, ensuring robust security measures and maintaining user accountability.

### Key Components:

- **User Authentication:** Access to the suite of bike management functionalities requires users to be registered and authenticated, introducing an additional layer of security to the system.
- **Change Bike Status:** Authenticated users can dynamically modify the status of bikes within the inventory. The available statuses include "Available," "Busy," and "Unavailable," empowering users to tailor the information based on real-time availability.
- **Delete Bikes:** Registered users wield the authority not only to manage the status of bikes but also to delete them from the platform. This functionality enhances data management efficiency, keeping the bike inventory up-to-date.
- **Add New Bikes:** In addition to managing existing bikes, registered users can actively contribute to the platform by adding new bikes. This inclusive feature encourages user participation and expands the diversity of available bikes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface is thoughtfully designed to be user-friendly, ensuring an intuitive and seamless experience for users engaged in managing bike statuses, deletions, and additions.
